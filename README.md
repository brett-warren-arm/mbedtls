Mbed TLS - Experimental branch
==============================

# Introduction

This is the experimental branch of [Mbed TLS](https://github.com/armmbed/mbedtls). Please see the corresponding
[README.md](https://github.com/armmbed/mbedtls/tree/development/README.md) for more information on Mbed TLS. This readme
focuses on the specifics of the experimental branch.

This branch hosts the development of experimental and exploratory features of Mbed TLS. Most of the
development happening here is intended to be upstreamed to main Mbed TLS, but might not yet reached
the necessary level of code quality and/or testing and/or documentation.

## Feedback and Contribution

If you are interested in trying out or contributing to the features that are being developed here, please reach out! We
welcome any feedback and support, and it will accelerate the process of getting the features in a production ready state
suitable for upstreaming to Mbed TLS' `development` branch.

If you want to share any feedback, just open an issue. If you've made an improvement, open a PR. And if you
have questions of any kind, drop us a line - the main point of contact is [@hanno-arm](https://github.com/hanno-arm).
